### OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
In the ever-changing educational environment, universities and colleges are struggling with the task of managing resources effectively in the face of changing demands. Traditional methods often prove inadequate, lacking the transparency and efficiency needed to meet modern expectations. To address these challenges, we propose the development of a Campus Resource Management System (CRMS) specifically tailored to the needs of educational institutions.The CRMS serves as a centralized platform that integrates a variety of administrative and operational processes, such as facility booking, event management, and student and faculty management. By integrating these functions, CRMS improves efficiency and communication while optimizing resource utilization. The system empowers stakeholders with an user-friendly interface that promotes productivity and collaboration across the campus community. As educational institutions embrace innovation and technology, CRMS serves as a catalyst for positive change, opening up new possibilities for growth and student success. <br>

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
#### High possibility of human error in administrative tasks
Human error will increase when using a manual system that highly relies on human resources. Many administrative tasks such as equipment requests and faculty maintenance requests are performed manually. Hence, it can result in a time consuming and error-prone process.
#### Inefficient Announcement Delivery and Management
 When the system experiences downtime, the staff's announcements will be made through social media platforms such as WhatsApp, which is the primary medium to make announcements to send to the students.
 #### Registration
Currently, all the registration procedures undergo a manual process such as filling out forms manually. During registration, most of the personal information, including private and sensitive information of students and parents will be collected.  However, this manual process is prone to errors and delays. Therefore, there is a pressing need to enhance security, and improve the overall registration experience
<br>
### PROPOSED SOLUTION
To solve the problem of inefficient announcement delivery, we need to develop a dedicated mobile application for the system that allows users to receive notifications directly on their smartphones. At the same time, ensuring that the system will be accessible via mobile devices is a must for us to develop so that everyone can use it at any time, anywhere. The system will allow us to access resource information, perform tasks on-the-go and enhance convenience and productivity. This is not only saving time and effort but also ensures consistency and accuracy.
To ensure continuous availability of the payment processing system , we are able to build backup servers to avoid the unexpected downtime. For example, when the main system triggers a downtime period of the payment, it will automatically switch to the backup system. Consequently, it can minimize disruption of the payment processing. In addition, constructing an online registration portal can simplify data collection without wasting time. This portal should be user-friendly and accessible from various devices to fit in with different users’ needs. Moreover, we should develop continuous improvement and feedback mechanisms from users. It is because the functionality and usability of the CRMS can be improved based on user needs from time to time.


### CURRENT BUSINESS PROCESS
Here are the scenarios and workflow of current business process for stakeholder:
Login to the system:
#### -> 1.1 Users (students, faculty and staff) enter their id and password to access the Campus Resource Management System (CRMS).
Customizing according to preference:
#### -> 2.1 Users can set preferences for notifications, display settings and booking options.
Main Menu Options:
#### -> 3.1 The system displays various options such as Facility Booking and Management, Student Management, Communication and Notification.
Facility Booking and Management:
#### -> 4.1 Facility Booking 
#### -> 4.2 View Facility Details
#### -> 4.3 Book Facility
#### -> 4.4 Manage Bookings
#### -> 4.5 Check Booking And Payment Status
Student Management:
#### -> 5.1 Manage Student Enrolment
#### -> 5.2 Course Registration
#### -> 5.3 View Academic Profiles 
#### -> 5.4 Manage Student Activities
#### -> 5.5 Track Academic Progress
Communication and Notification:
#### -> 6.1 Send Announcements
#### -> 6.2 Receive Notifications
#### -> 6.3 Check Notification History

### SUMMARY of PROPOSED SYSTEM
In summary, the proposed Campus Resource Management System (CRMS) provided a more efficient and user friendly platform in order to enhance the user experience in the campus. The CRMS system revolutionized and modernized the management and the operation processes of the campus resources. This system promotes eco-friendly practices as most of the processes are digitized and automated, which helps a lot in saving paper as bookings facilities, retrieve data and all the communication within the departments in the campus can be done through the system. Furthermore, it indeed helps to save time and also manpower as all the processes are modernized. CRMS is a system that tracks the real time availability of the campus resources and facilities through which users are able to check the availability of the facilities instantly using the system. Hence, the system indirectly speeds up the reservation process. Users are able to make a reservation easily by using the system without even going to the department. In addition, it also allows users to access all the information easily within seconds as all the information and data are stored in the system database.
